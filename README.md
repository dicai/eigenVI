# eigenVI

EigenVI is an eigenvalue-based framework for score-based variational inference.
Here we consider variational families built from orthogonal function expansions.
Minimizing a stochastic estimate of the a score-based divergence (the
Fisher divergence) reduces to solving an eigenvalue problem.

In this repository, we provide simple examples of EigenVI using normalized Hermite polynomials.
